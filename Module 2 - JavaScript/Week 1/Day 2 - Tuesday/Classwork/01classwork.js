//! LOOP PRACTICE

// -----------------------------------------------------------------

//! Take an input from the user. Starting with the 4th character,
//! log all characters until the end of the input.
//! If the input is shorter than 4 characters, nothing should be logged.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------

//! Pick a random number. Prompt the user to guess a number.
//! If the number is correct, end the loop and tell the user how many tries it took to guess.
//! If it is incorrect, continue the loop.
//! (Test functionality by logging the number that was randomly generated in the prompt).

// To get a random number: Math.floor(Math.random() * max) + 1;
// Math.random generates a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
// We multiply that number by the max value you want.
// Math.floor always rounds the number down.
// If max = 10, it should generate a random number from 1 to 10.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------

//! Using nested for loops, create and log the following pattern:
/*
//!    *
//!    **
//!    ***
//!    ****
//!    *****
*/

// -----------------------------------------------------------------

//! Simulate a coin flip. Start a counter at 0. If the initial flip was heads,
//! leave the counter at 0 and log: "It took 0 retries to get heads!".
//! If the coin was tails, try again and keep doing so until heads happens. Log the amount of retries it took.

// COMPARISON PRACTICE
// -----------------------------------------------------------------

//! Build a simple site that prompts a user for their first name and then a number
//! between one and one-hundred (inclusive).
//!  - Tell them whether their number is odd or even and if its greater than,
//!    less than, or equal to 50 and then log those messages separately to the console.
//!  - Log every number before theirs and every number from 100 counting down to theirs in two separate loops.
//!  - If their name is your name send an alert saying that it is a great name.

// Use toLowerCase() method to make their name entirely lower case.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------

//! Take the following arrays: `[-1,-2,2,10,7,8]` and `[4,-2,2,7,9,5]`
//! and see how many items the two arrays share in common.
//! Do this without prototypical methods (don't use array.filter and array.includes).
//! You will need a nested loop.
